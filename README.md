# chainify-demo

This is "[chainify](https://github.com/carlostojal/chainify)" demo.

This example consists of a REST API built with Express, using a "chainify" network as distributed storage.

The optimal way of trying it out is using "Docker Compose", to see multiple nodes in action. Be sure to start the nodes in the order node1 -> node2 -> node3.

Please note that "chainify" is a work in progress.
