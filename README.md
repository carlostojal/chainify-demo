# chainify-demo

This is "[chainify]("https://github.com/carlostojal/chainify")" demo.

This example consists of a REST API built with Express, using a "chainify" network as distributed storage.

The optimal way of trying it out is using "Docker Compose", to see multiple nodes in action. Be sure to edit IP addresses on the ```docker-compose.yml``` file to match the container addresses.

Please note that "chainify" is a work in progress.
